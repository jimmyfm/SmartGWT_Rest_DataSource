# GWT Base Project

That's just a simple and plain set of clean project that I use as a base for tech tests and demos.

It uses **GWT 2.7.0** because if you are going to write real-world stuff, that's what you're going to use.

You can easily run it with 
```sh
mvn gwt:run
```

Or if you need to run a compiled version (like i had to)
```sh
mvn jetty:run-war
```

## Packages
* **master** Vanilla GWT 2.7.0
